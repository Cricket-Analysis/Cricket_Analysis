AIM: Create SQL Database and run 20 queries assignment for DBMS Mini Project

Explanation:
In the database that you created in Assignment 4, formulate and execute each of the following queries in SQL. In each case, you should attempt to handle the task in a single (possibly nested) SQL statement, without using views or SQL subqueries in the FROM clause.

File named build.sql should contain the complete script with which you constructed your database (i.e., all CREATE and all INSERT statements).

File named dump.sql should contain a script for a complete listing of your database (similar to Assignment 4).

File named dump.txt should contain the output of the execution of the script dump.sql 4. File named queries.sql should contain the SQL statements for each of the 10 problems of this homework.

File named queries.txt should contain the output of the execution of the script queries.sql.
