Explanation:
In the database that you created for the Mini Project, formulate and execute each of the following queries in SQL. In each case, you should attempt to handle the task in a single (possibly nested) SQL statement, without using views.

1.File named cricket_analysis.sql should contain the complete script with which you constructed your database (i.e., all CREATE and all INSERT statements).

2.File named dump.sql should contain a script for a complete listing of your database (similar to Assignment 4).

3.Folder Images_Output contains all the images of  the output of the execution of the script cricket_analysis.sql.
